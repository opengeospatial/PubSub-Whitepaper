# White Paper template

This GitHub repository contains the content for an OGC White Paper.

The repo is organized as follows:

* index.adoc - nothing in this document
* white_paper - the main White Paper document content
  - organized in multiple sections and directories
  - this is the only part needed to create a White Paper document
  - White Papers have no set structure, so organize the content as best fits your purposes
