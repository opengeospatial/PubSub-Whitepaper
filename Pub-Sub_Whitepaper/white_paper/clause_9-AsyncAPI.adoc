== AsyncAPI description

OGC Web API Standards build on the design patterns described by the OpenAPI Interface Design Language (IDL). The use of an IDL has proven invaluable in the development of OGC Web API Standards. OpenAPI provides a set of common concepts for the design of a Web API and rules for the application of those concepts. Without this common language, the task of coordinating multiple API standardization efforts would be almost impossible.

The OGC is now looking to extend our Request-Response APIs to include event driven (asynchronous) operations. However, OpenAPI does not support event driven operations beyond a simple call-back model. So an IDL for event driven Web APIs is needed.

AsyncAPI is an open source initiative that seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA). Their long-term goal is to make working with EDAâ€™s as easy as it is to work with REST APIs. That goes from documentation to code generation, from discovery to event management. Most of the processes used for REST APIs should also be applicable to event-driven/asynchronous APIs. This section provides an introduction to AsyncAPI as an additional tool for use in developing OGC Web API standards.

=== Concepts

[[definitionsApplication]]
==== Application

An application is any kind of computer program or a group of them. It MUST be a <<definitionsProducer,producer>>, a <<definitionsConsumer,consumer>> or both. An application MAY be a microservice, IoT device (sensor), mainframe process, etc. An application MAY be written in any number of different programming languages as long as they support the selected <<definitionsProtocol,protocol>>. An application MUST also use a protocol supported by the server in order to connect and exchange <<definitionsMessage,messages>>.

[[definitionsBindings]]
==== Bindings

A "binding" (or "protocol binding") is a mechanism to define protocol-specific information. Therefore, a protocol binding MUST define protocol-specific information only.

[[definitionsChannel]]
==== Channel

A channel is an addressable component, made available by the server, for the organization of <<definitionsMessage,messages>>. <<definitionsProducer,Producer>> applications send messages to channels and <<definitionsConsumer,consumer>> applications consume messages from channels. Servers MAY support many channel instances, allowing messages with different content to be addressed to different channels. Depending on the server implementation, the channel MAY be included in the message via protocol-defined headers.

[[definitionsConsumer]]
==== Consumer

A consumer is a type of application, connected to a server via a supported <<definitionsProtocol,protocol>>, that is consuming <<definitionsMessage,messages>> from <<definitionsChannel,channels>>. A consumer MAY be consuming from multiple channels depending on the server, protocol, and the use-case pattern.

[[definitionsMessage]]
==== Message

A message is the mechanism by which information is exchanged via a channel between servers and applications. A message MUST contain a payload and MAY also contain headers. The headers MAY be subdivided into <<definitionsProtocol,protocol>>-defined headers and header properties defined by the application which can act as supporting metadata. The payload contains the data, defined by the application, which MUST be serialized into a format (JSON, XML, Avro, binary, etc.). Since a message is a generic mechanism, it can support multiple interaction patterns such as event, command, request, or response.

[[definitionsProducer]]
==== Producer

A producer is a type of application, connected to a server, that is creating <<definitionsMessage,messages>> and addressing them to <<definitionsChannel,channels>>. A producer MAY be publishing to multiple channels depending on the server, protocol, and use-case pattern.

[[definitionsProtocol]]
==== Protocol

A protocol is the mechanism (wireline protocol or API) by which <<definitionsMessage,messages>> are exchanged between the application and the <<definitionsChannel,channel>>. Example protocols include, but are not limited to, AMQP, HTTP, JMS, Kafka, MQTT, STOMP, Mercure, WebSocket.

=== The AsyncAPI Specification

AsyncAPI can be viewed as an extension of OpenAPI. Many of the objects and structures defined in OpenAPI can also be found in AsynAPI. However, there are some important differences.

==== AsyncAPI Object

The AsyncAPI Object is similar to the OpenAPI Object. This object organizes the top-level components of the AsyncAPI file. <<#asyncAPI-object>> describes the AsyncAPI object and how it differs from its' OpenAPI counterpart.

[#asyncAPI-object,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.AsyncAPI Object
[cols="15,^15,85",options="header"]
|====
| Field Name | Type | Description
| asyncapi | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#A2SVersionString[AsyncAPI Version String] | **Required.** Serves the same function as the openAPI field. The format of the asyncAPI field is defined by the schema. OpenAPI uses the same format, but defines it in the text of the standard.
| id | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#A2SIdString[Identifier] | *Specific to AsyncAPI.* Identifier of the <<definitionsApplication,application>> the AsyncAPI document is defining.
| info | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#infoObject[Info Object] | **Required.** Same as OpenAPI.
| servers | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#serversObject[Servers Object] | Differs from OpenAPI. In OpenAPI this is an array of Server Objects while in AsyncAPI it is a map of Server Objects. The structure of the <<server-object-section,Server Objects>> themselves also differ.
| channels | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#channelsObject[Channels Object] | **Required**. <<channel-object-section,Channels>> are similar to OpenAPI Paths in that they identify a resource. The main difference is that a path is used to access the current resource while a channel is used to distribute all instances of that resource over a period of time.
| components | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#componentsObject[Components Object] | The Components Object serves the same function in AsyncAPI as it does in OpenAPI. The categories of components managed, however, are very different. See the <<components-object-section,Components Object>> section for more information.
| tags | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#tagsObject[Tags Object] |Same as in OpenAPI.
| externalDocs | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#externalDocumentationObject[External Documentation Object] | Same as in OpenAPI.
|====

It's notable that AsyncAPI does not include Security Requirements in the root file. Instead, security is addressed by the <<server-object-section,Server Objects>>.

[[components-object-section]]
==== Components Object

The AsyncAPI Components Object provides the same functionality and structure as the Components Object in OpenAPI. The difference is in the types of components that can be included.

<<#components-object>> describes the Components object and how it differs from its' OpenAPI counterpart.

|====

[[server-object-section]]
==== Server Objects

Servers are described by two objects; the Servers Object (plural) and the Server Object (singular).

A Servers Object provides a map of Server Objects with each Server Object refrenced by an identifier (the map key). This differs from OpebnAPI where the Server Objects are packaged as an array.

<<#server-object>> describes the Server object and how it differs from its' OpenAPI counterpart.

[#server-object,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Server Object
[cols="15,^15,85",options="header"]
|====
| Field Name | Type | Description
| url | ``string`` | **REQUIRED**. Same as in OpenAPI.
| protocol | ``string`` | **REQUIRED**, *Specific to AsyncAPI*. The protocol this URL supports for connection. Supported protocol include, but are not limited to: ``amqp``, ``amqps``, ``http``, ``https``, ``jms``, ``kafka``, ``kafka-secure``, ``mqtt``, ``secure-mqtt``, ``stomp``, ``stomps``, ``ws``, ``wss``, ``mercure``.
| protocolVersion | ``string`` | *Specific to AsyncAPI*. The version of the protocol used for connection. For instance: AMQP ``0.9.1``, HTTP ``2.0``, Kafka ``1.0.0``, etc.
| description | ``string`` | Same as OpenAPI.
| variables | Map[``string``, https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#serverVariableObject[Server Variable Object]] | Same as OpenAPI except that the AsyncAPI includes an `examples` field in the Server Variable Object.
| security | [https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#securityRequirementObject[Security Requirement Object]] | *Specific to AsyncAPI*. AsyncAPI applies security requirements in the Server Object while OpenAPI applies them on the Path. The Server Scheme Objects are nearly identical, differing only in the valid values for the `type` and `in` fields.
| bindings | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#serverBindingsObject[Server Bindings Object] | *Specific to AsyncAPI*. A map where the keys describe the name of the protocol and the values describe protocol-specific definitions for the server.
|====

[[channel-object-section]]
==== Channel Object

Channels are described by two objects; the Channels Object (plural) and the Channel Object (singular).

A Channels Object provides a map of Channel Objects with each Channel Object refrenced by an identifier (the map key).

<<#channel-object>> describes the Channel object.

[#channel-object,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Channel Object
[cols="15,^15,85",options="header"]
|====
| Field Name | Type | Description
| $ref | ``string`` | Allows for an external definition of this channel item. The referenced structure MUST be in the format of a <<channel-item-object-section,Channel Item Object>>. If there are conflicts between the referenced definition and this Channel Item's definition, the behavior is __undefined__.
| description | ``string`` | An optional description of this channel item. http://spec.commonmark.org/[CommonMark syntax] can be used for rich text representation.

present only when using channels with expressions (as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-2.2[RFC 6570 section 2.2]).
| bindings | https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#channelBindingsObject[Channel Bindings Object] | A map where the keys describe the name of the protocol and the values describe protocol-specific definitions for the channel.
|====

[[channel-item-object-section]]
==== Channel Item Object

The Channel Item Object is similar to the Path Item Object in OpenAPI. Both describe the available operations (publish and subscribe vs. the HTTP verbs) and the parameters for those operations. They also differ in two other major ways:

* Channel Item Object includes a `bindings` field. This field is not needed in the Path Items object since the binding is always HTTP.
* Path Items Objects include a `servers` field to identify the target of requests.

<<#channel-item-object>> describes the Channel Item object.

[[operation-binding-section]]
==== Operation Object

The AsyncAPI Operation Object serves in a similar role as the OpenAPI Operation Object, but requires a very different set of data to do so.

<<#operation-object>> describes the Operation object and how it differs from its' OpenAPI counterpart.

| traits | <<operation-trate-object,Operation Trait Object>> OR +
<<referenceObject,Reference Object>> | *Specific to AsyncAPI*. A list of traits to apply to the operation object. Traits MUST be merged into the operation object using the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386[JSON Merge Patch] algorithm in the same order they are defined here.
| message | <<messageObject,Message Object>> +
<<referenceObject,Reference Object>> | *Specific to AsyncAPI*. A definition of the message that will be published or received on this channel. ``oneOf`` is allowed here to specify multiple messages, however, **a message MUST be valid only against one of the referenced message objects.**
|====

The AsyncAPI Operation Object excludes a number of fields which are defined in the OpenAPI Operation Object:

* parameters
* requestBody
* responses
* callBacks
* deprecated
* security
* servers

[[server-binding-object-section]]
==== Server Binding Object

The Server Binding Object is specific to AsyncAPI.

This object is a map describing protocol-specific definitions for a server. These objects are specific to AsyncAPI.

[[channel-binding-object-section]]
==== Channel Binding Object

The Channel Binding Object is specific to AsyncAPI.

The Channel Binding Object and <<server-binding-object-section,Server Binding Object>> are almost identical. They support the same protocols. However, there may be differences in the protocol details.

[[message-binding-object-section]]
==== Message Binding Object

The Message Binding Object is specific to AsyncAPI.

The Message Binding Object and <<server-binding-object-section,Server Binding Object>> are almost identical. They support the same protocols. However, there may be differences in the protocol details.

[[operation-binding-object-section]]
==== Operation Binding Object

The Operation Binding Object is specific to AsyncAPI.

The Operation Binding Object and <<server-binding-object-section,Server Binding Object>> are almost identical. They support the same protocols. However, there may be differences in the protocol details.

[[parameter-object-section]]
==== Parameters

Parameters are described by two objects; the _Parameters Object_ (plural) and the _Parameter Object_ (singular).

A _Parameters Object_ provides a map of _Parameter Objects_ while each _Parameter Object_ referenced by an identifier (the map key).

AsyncAPIs are considerably simpler than those defined in OpenAPI; So, they should be treated as different objects.

<<#parameter-object>> describes the AsyncAPI _Parameter Object_.

| location | ``string`` | A https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md#runtimeExpression[runtime expression] that specifies the location of the parameter value. Even when a definition for the target field exists, it MUST NOT be used to validate this parameter but, instead, the ``schema`` property MUST be used.
|====

==== Message Object

Logically, an OpenAPI Response Object and an AsyncAPI Message
Object are expected to be very similar.
In practice, the information exchanged may be similar too; however, the information
needed to describe that exchange is very different.
Thus, the Message Object bears little resemblance to its OpenAPI counterpart.
